1; 0.517; Applied undersampling to the majority class, reducing it to 0.6, and performed feature engineering on "especies"
2; 0.69714; CHANGED Adjusted undersampling to 0.2 for the majority class
3; 0.70421; CHANGED Adjusted undersampling to 0.15 for the majority class
4; 0.70871; CHANGED Further reduced undersampling to 0.125 for the majority class
5; 0.71767; ADDED Introduced new feature engineering on "altura" and "diametro"
6; 0.71641; ADDED Incorporated additional feature engineering for "seccion"
